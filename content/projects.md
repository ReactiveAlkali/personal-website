## Shields Up!
![Shields Up! title screen](/images/projects/shieldsUp.jpg#thumbnail)
This game was made for the University of Manitoba Computer Science Students Association 2nd Annual Game Jam.

In this game you take control of a spaceship where your defence is your greatest offence. Use your shield to deflect enemy bullets right back at them and survive as long as possible. The spawn rate of 
enemies gradually increases making the game harder the longer you play.

I created this game as part of a four person team in our first ever game jam. I was responsible mainly for implementing the enemies, shield deflection mechanics, and also finding game assets. I was also
responsible for proposing the initial idea of the game. You can get the game on [itch.io](https://reactivealkali.itch.io/shields-up) or find the code [here](https://github.com/ReactiveAlkali/shields-up)
