I am an undergraduate student currently pursuing a computer science - physics joint honours degree at the University of Manitoba.  I am a member of the Organization of Physics Undergraduate Students (OPUS)
and spend a lot of time hanging out in the OPUS lounge.  While not as active in the Computer Science community I have participated in a Computer Science Students Association (CSSA) game jam.  

Outside of class I enjoy sewing, playing video games, reading, and playing Dungeons and Dragons.
